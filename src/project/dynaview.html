        The software monitored a hydraulic dynamometer and various other sensors relating to engine performance. 
        After capture, the readings were stored in a database for later export and analysis. 
        In addition to the software, I developed the prototype hardware to interface with the dynamometer and thermometer as a proof of concept. 
        C# was used as the main language for software development, WPF was used for the interface. NHibernate was used for database access and RS232 was used for the hardware communication protocol. 
        In order to generate reports, I wrote a custom parser with F#, FsLex and FsYacc. 
        The report generator supported a wide variety of user-supplied expressions to be used in reports.
